This project demonstrates how to use **JDBC** in a clean, layered architecture without any UI.  
It includes basic operations to:
- Add a new donor  
- Fetch all donors  
- Find donor by ID or blood group  
- Update donor information  
- Delete donor by ID  

This is a great foundation for understanding how the **DAO (Data Access Object)** pattern works in enterprise applications.
